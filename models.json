    "description": "A mesmerizing formation of MUST and DUST over the remains of a conventional spaceship. At close range it looks like the minerals are taking the shape of two glowing humanoïds holding hands on the hull. The Gemini moves in space with dazing ease as if it was kindered with the approaching asteroïds. The Gallactic Arcana records a total of five transmissions from such a vessel. They were were all laconic and mirrored: 'MUST pulling fees updated, update of the pulling fees in MUST'.",

Legends say the Gorgo is not a spaceship but a comet which came to life, a giant head with glowing eyes that turn approaching spaceships into petracks. This is most likely drunkman tales from the Cosmic Pub. The composition of this spaceship could nevertheless be pure refined MUST and would thus fool other spaceships in seeing it as a comet from afar.  Investigations are ongoing to localize a Gorgo, the best clue so far is a rare anomaly: a fast expending path of extrelemly low MUST concentration in the galaxy that could be the trail of previously undetected extremely powerful astrominer.",
